This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=77

This script generates menu entries for each include file within the actual edited C/C++ file.
After executing it, you can enter any of the include files by selecting them via menu.

The script is just quick and (hope not very) dirty written, but working (only short tests up to now)
under GVIM 5.8, NT4.0, Novell network
